This package is for Google Feedback API client code.

Here is the guide on integrating google feedback in android pre-ics:

The guide says to copy this code from:
java/com/google/userfeedback/android/api

This client code was copied and changed to support auto reporting exceptions.
User interaction and PII data were removed.
All changes are marked with NOTE comments, except import changes.
Imports were changed to not use internal google libs.
